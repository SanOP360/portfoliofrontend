      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Sanjay Chauhan, a dedicated and enthusiastic B.Tech graduate
        from the ECE branch with a passion for leveraging technology to build
        innovative solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a
        strong foundation in electronics and communication engineering, which
        has provided me with a unique perspective in approaching challenges in
        the realm of technology. However, it is my fervent interest in web
        development, particularly Full Stack Development, that truly ignites my
        professional drive.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey in web development has been exhilarating, as I continuously
        strive to expand my skill set and explore emerging technologies.
        Proficient in the MERN stack, including React, MongoDB, Express, and
        Next.js, I am adept at crafting dynamic and responsive web applications
        that deliver seamless user experiences. Moreover, my expertise extends
        to front-end technologies such as HTML and CSS, where I ensure
        pixel-perfect designs and intuitive user interfaces. Additionally, my
        proficiency in back-end development, coupled with my knowledge of C++
        and competitive coding, empowers me to tackle complex problems with
        efficiency and precision.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond technical skills, I bring a strong sense of creativity,
        problem-solving acumen, and a collaborative mindset to every project I
        undertake. I am deeply committed to continuous learning and growth,
        always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to broaden my
        horizons in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
